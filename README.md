### Minecraft Server Wrapper for Realtime Git World Backups ###

CURRENTLY UNSTABLE - NOT RECOMMENDED FOR LIVE MINECRAFT SERVERS

Why save the entire world when you can just save the changes.

Commands

/git-commit - Commits the current world to the repository

/git-log - List all commits for the current world

/git-reset <id> - Will shutdown the server, reset to a previous commit, and then start the server.
